Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning that helps improve model efficiency and performance. Reducing the number of irrelevant or redundant features, lowers the dimensionality of the dataset, speeding up computation and reducing the risk of overfitting. This enables the model to focus on the most important features, leading to better generalization and more accurate predictions. Overall, feature selection simplifies the model, enhances interpretability, and improves its ability to make predictions on unseen data.
Objective: The goal of the project is to apply genetic algorithms for feature selection in a classification task using the Default of Credit Card Clients dataset.

About Dataset: 
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April to September 2005. The dataset is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset?resource=download 


Performance Comparison  between Genetic Operators: Uniform Crossover, Bit-flipping Mutation, Fitness-proportionate Selection & Round Robin and in the other hand, is Genetic Operators: N-point Crossover, flipping Mutation, Tournament Selection & (μ+λ)-Selection to see which og them can give us a higher accuracy(best fitness) accros the genertations.
